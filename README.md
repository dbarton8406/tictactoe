# My TicTacToe game.
Deliverables

A script tic-tac-toe.rb
Requirements

Running ruby tic-tac-toe.rb should play a game of tic-tac-toe in the terminal.
Easy Mode

The script should play a game of tic-tac-toe to completion and print the game's outcome. Each turn, the script displays the current board and prompts the user for a move. It may either have two human players or a human player and a computer player that chooses a move randomly.

Normal Mode

The script should fulfill the Easy Mode requirements and support both a human and computer second player.

Hard Mode

The AI should try to do something intelligent instead of choosing random empty spaces. Hardcoding "if the board is this, play this" is tractable, but there are several valid approaches.

Nightmare Mode

Make it so that the computer will never lose.
